    	<BODILY_INJURY_LIABILITY><![CDATA[
    	This coverage pays damages owed to others as a result of bodily injuries for which you are legally liable.
Bodily injury means bodily injury to or sickness, disease or death of any person. Bodily Injury Liability Coverage is written showing two limits, for example, 100,000/300,000. Known as split-limit liability, the first figure, 100,000, means the company is liable for an amount up to $100,000 for bodily injury damages for one person per occurrence. Liability in excess of $100,000 for one person would not be the company's responsibility.
The second figure, 300,000, refers to the maximum liability ($300,000) the company has when bodily injuries are suffered by two or more persons per occurrence. For example, if five persons were injured due to an insured's negligence, each one having suffered $75,000 of bodily injury damages, a total of $375,000 (75,000 x 5) has to be raised to pay the judgment in full. American Family is limited to $300,000 for this occurrence so the insured would be liable for the difference.
Bodily Injury Liability Coverage: 
•	Protects the named insureds in the policy. 
•	Protects household members while driving autos authorized under the policy. 
•	Protects others driving your auto with your permission. 
•	Protects you when you use most types of trailers with your auto. 
The descriptions contained herein are only a general description of terms and available coverages and are not a statement of contract. All coverages are subject to all policy provisions and applicable endorsements.

    	<PROPERTY_DAMAGE_LIABILITY>
    	<![CDATA[
    	This coverage pays for property damage sustained by others for which you are legally liable. Property damage means damage to or destruction of tangible property, including loss of its use. The limit of coverage selected is the Company's maximum liability for all property damage resulting from one occurrence. 
Property Damage Liability Coverage: 
•	Protects the named insured in the policy. 
•	Protects household members while driving autos authorized under the policy. 
•	Protects others driving your auto with your permission. 
•	Protects you when you use most types of trailers with your auto.
